Home Lab Projects: Network Security and Architecture with Cisco Packet Tracer

Welcome to my collection of hands-on home lab projects, built using Cisco Packet Tracer. This repository showcases various network designs and simulations, focusing on security best practices and advanced networking concepts.

Each project is designed to simulate real-world scenarios, enhancing both practical skills and theoretical understanding in network security, routing protocols, and network troubleshooting. These simulations are part of my journey to deepen expertise in the field of network engineering and security.

Explore the projects to see detailed network topologies, configuration scripts, and security measures implemented to address potential vulnerabilities. This repository serves as a portfolio of my skills in network architecture, with a special focus on security and efficient routing.
